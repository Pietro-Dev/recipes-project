# RECIPES PROJECT

The recipe project is a website where there are my three favorite dishes.

On the main page, index.html, there is:

- A main title
- A main image
- Three links for each dish

Each dish has its own html page where there is:

- Dish name
- Image of the dish
- Description of the dish
- Dish ingredients
- Steps to prepare the dish
- A link to return to the main page, index.html
